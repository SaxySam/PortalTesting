/* This class takes a list of vertices and triangle indices which 
 * make up a polygon and returns a list of the vertices ordered so that
 * they define the outline of an object. We use this in portal culling
 * so that we can get the top left and bottom right vertices without
 * having to know the winding order of the triangles which make up the portal
 * 
 * This was originally written as Unity arbitrarily changed the winding order
 * of their Quads between versions which broke the original code. There was
 * no reason for them to do this, and no promise that it wouldn't happen again
 * so this code will *hopefully* make sure that if it does happen again, our
 * code will keep running
